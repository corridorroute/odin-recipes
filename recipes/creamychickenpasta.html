                <li>4 cooked chicken breasts (about 450g), shredded with a fork</li>
                <li>100g frozen peas</li>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Cook the pasta following pack instructions. Reserve 100ml of the water and drain the pasta in a colander.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, heat the oil in a frying pan on a medium heat and fry the garlic and spinach for 3 mins until wilted. Add the soft cheese and heat until melted. Stir in most of the parmesan, then add the shredded chicken, peas and some of the pasta water. Bring to the boil and bubble for 2-3 mins until the chicken and peas are completely heated through.</li>
                <li>Add the pasta and stir until combined. Add more pasta water to loosen the sauce, if needed. Remove from heat, sprinkle over the remaining parmesan and parsley or basil to serve.</li>
